        <p>National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) is promoted by SM Charitable Educational Trust. The Trust was established in 1995 by Dr Sukant K Mohapatra and Ms Sanjeeta Mohapatra (both are NRIs based in US) as Founder/Donor Trustees. Dr Sukant Mohapatra is the founder chairman of the Trust and NIST supporting and providing visionary guidance for NIST to become a world class institute. NIST was established in the year 1996 by a group of academicians and technocrats educated in the top institutes of India and abroad. It is the first NRI educational venture in the state of Odisha and first engineering college under Berhampur University and southern Odisha. The primary objective of the founders was to promote NIST as a center of academic excellence and research at par with international universities in their home state of Odisha.</p>

        <p>Keeping true to its core value, mission and vision, NIST has become a top notch institute in the state and country since its establishment in 1996.</p>
